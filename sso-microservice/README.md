## Development Setup

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast Python package management and [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- uv (install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:jarey-ds/anything-llm-helm-chart.git
   cd sso-microservice
   ```

3. Install dependencies (this also sets up pre-commit hooks):

   ```bash
   uv run task install
   ```

   Pre-commit hooks are automatically installed to ensure code quality checks run before commits and tests run before pushes.

4. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   uv run task test
   ```

5. Run linting:

   ```bash
   uv run task lint
   ```

6. Format code:
   ```bash
   uv run task format
   ```

### Running the Application

```bash
uv run task run
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000
